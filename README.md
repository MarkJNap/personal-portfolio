# My Personal Portfolio

## Description
For this project I created a personal website portfolio from scratch using both CSS and HTML. The creation of such a page is important to showcase my skills and highlight my work. This will help me on my journey as I become a full-stack developer by being a spot for potential job recruiters to find me. In the creative proccess of making this I experienced a lot of trial and error as I set my goals too high initially for the length of time I had. Still some issues I need to work out invovling screen resizing and having cleaner css.

## Installation
No installation steps needed

## Usage
